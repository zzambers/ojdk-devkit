# ojdk-devkit
Specfiles for packages with OpenJDK devkit (quick an ugly :) ).

### OpenJDK devkit
OpenJDK devkit is basically toolchain, which allows to build for different target than building on.
It can be generated by makefile from Openjdk sources.
Generated devkit is combination of tools (binutils, gcc etc..) built from source and sysroot created by unpacking rpms.
Originally it uses rpms from either `Oracle Linux` or `Fedora`. Specfiles in this project do modifications to use `CentOS` rpms,
with fallback to `Fedora` (if CentOS is not available for given arch).

### Building package
Packages can be built locally using mock (needs network access), e.g.:
```
mock -r epel-7-x86_64 --enable-network --rebuild --spec ojdk-devkit-11.spec --sources .
```

### Other
- Package build does testing of devkit in `%check` phase by trying to build OpenJDK with it.
- When package is installed archive with devkit is installed to `/usr/share/ojdk-devkit-*/*.tar.gz`.
